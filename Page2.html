<h3>
    About the Pearl city.. </h3>
        <b/>
<p> Hyderabad is the Capital city of southern state of Telangana in India. Established in 1591 by Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah,
It has the population of abouy 7 million making it thefourth most populous city in India. Telugu, Hindi and Urdu are the main
languages spoken in Hyderabad.The original city of Hyderabad was founded on the banks of river Musi. Now known as the historic 
old city, home to the Charminar, Falaknuma Palace, Chowmallah Palace and Makkah Masjid, it lies on the southern bank of the river. 
With this mixture of people, Hyderabad is also a mixture of religions. Hyderabad’s skyline boasts the distinctive minarets of mosques,
intricate figurines of Hindu temple gods, beautiful Churches and distinctive architecture of Gurudwaras. The main religions are Hinduism,
Islam, Christianity and Sikhism.</p>

     <h3> History..</h3>
    <p> When the British and French took hold over most of India, the Nizams played a delicate game of balance and subterfuge. They allied themselves with each side at different times, playing an important role in the wars involving Tipu Sultant, the French, and the British. The Nizams eventually won the friendship of the Western invaders without giving up their powers. As a result, Hyderabad was still ruled by a Nizam, and it became the largest princely state of India. As a princely state, Hyderabad had its own currency, railways, mint, and postal system. The citizens enjoyed no income tax.
        When India finally gained its independence in 1947, the Nizam at that time made known his intention to become independent, either by gaining dominion status by the British Empire or as a sovereign ruler. The Nizam signed a Standstill Agreement with the Indian Union which, by this time, had surrounded him on all sides. Breakdown in law and order soon followed, with fights between the supporters of the Nizam and the supporters of Congress. As the violence spiraled out of control, the newly established Indian government initiated a police action called Operation Polo. On September 16, 1948, the Indian army moved in to the state of Hyderabad in five fronts. Five days later, the Nizam’s army surrendered, and the Nizam signed the Instrument of Accession, integrating Hyderabad into the Indian Union as a state. </p>

     <h3> Hyderabad's IT industry..</h3>
         <p> After Bangalore, Hyderabad has been dubbed as the Silicon Valley of India, mainly in light of the fact that more and more firms have set up their operations there. Starting in the 1990s, software companies, business process outsourcing (BPO) firms, call centers, and other technological services were set up, making it the center for all call center operations, technological development, and KPOs in all of India. There are several reasons why these large multinational information technology giants have chosen Hyderabad as one of their base of operations in South Asia: for one, the untapped intellectual talent in the region is immense, especially in the field of technology and mathematics. Another reason is that labour is especially cheap and abundant. Most companies will be able to hire more workers at almost half the cost when they’re in the West. India (and, in extension, Hyderabad) also have labuor standards that are pretty much more reasonable and relaxed, as well as a working environment that is conducive to work.+</p>
